# Food-Access-Visualization-Project

### Project Overview: 

In conjunction with Professor Valerie Nazzaro's Data Visualization course, I developed an interactive dashboard to visually explore food access within the US. This project utilizes the USDA's Food Access Research Atlas and geometries from the Census Bureau to explore the linkages between access to food stores, race, and income. Because food access typically occurs at the neighborhood level, all visualizations are displayed in terms of census tracts. This application is publicly available at https://azagoren.shinyapps.io/food_access/ in the hopes that low to middle income individuals may use it as a tool to consider whilst making housing decisions.
